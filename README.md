# Postman-Click2Mail-SDK
Reference collection of Click2Mail APIs in Postman

Import these 3 json files into Postman. One is the collection, other is the environment and the third is the global variables. Once imported, go to the environment (stage_user2) and add your stage username and password. You should be good to go for testing in stage. To create a production environment, duplicate the stage_user2 environment, replace "stage-rest" and "stage-batch" with "rest" and "batch" respectively. Add your production username and password.
